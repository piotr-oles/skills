Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/` — daily code work
- `productivity/` — daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/` — kept around but rarely used
- `in-progress/` — drafts not yet ready to ship
- `deprecated/` — no longer used

Every skill in `engineering/`, `productivity/`, or `misc/` must have a reference in the top-level `README.md`. Skills in `in-progress/` and `deprecated/` must not appear there.

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. Bucket `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable).
